Hello Fusion Masters!

Here are some easy instructions for you to follow when you want to play your game. At the end of the camp week, a stand-alone version of your game was made so you don't need Fusion to play it anymore! To play the game without opening Fusion, just Double-Click on the file that ends with ".exe". The icon is a yellow lightning bolt inside a red circle. You can play it right from your USB drive or you can copy it onto as many different computers as you want so all of your friends can play too.

If you have Fusion at home and want to keep working on it you can do that too! Just open the file that has the red F2 inside the blue circle just like we did in class; after opening it, you can start adding more fun! If you want to give the new version out to your friends, you'll have to build a stand alone application and give out the new ".exe" file instead.

How to do that:

    Save your game first.
    Click on the “File” menu up in the top left-hand corner.
    Click on “Build”.
    Click on “Application”.
    Name your game. (Make sure you find the right folder to save it to!)
    Save.

Unfortunately, Fusion is still not available on a system other than a PC, so this process will only work properly using a Windows-based computer. If you're on a Mac, you'll need some way to virtualize a Windows environment; this is possible through a program such as Parallels (http://www.parallels.com/), VMWare Fusion (http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/), or by installing Windows on your Mac using Boot Camp (http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/). If none of these options are available to you, you'll need to try a different computer that does have Windows running on it.
